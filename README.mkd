Simblin
=======

**Sim**ple **B**log Eng**in**e - A blog engine written with [Flask][] and
[SQLAlchemy][].

Simblin is built to be used by only one author. Simblin has no dashboard, no
plugin support and no theme support although the templates and css can be
modified by hand of course. Simblin does not provide its own comment system
but has support for [Disqus](http://disqus.com/).

On the other hand Simblin delivers most features that are needed to provide a
good blogging experience. Simblin has 

* tags and categories 
* markdown support
* archives
* source code highlighting

Simple is not to misinterpret as minimalistic. Had Simblin been a minimalistic
blog engine (*minblin* :)) there would have been no tags, categories etc. Only
one page that shows the five lates posts and a possibility to see older posts.
But that would have been a little to sparse for my taste...

See the changelog to see what featueres a specific version provides.


Configuration
-------------

TODO: This needs work

Don't forget version numbers!
* Link to deployment section of flask

requires flask and everything that flask requires

first run `python initdb.py` then run `python run.py`

put your real settings in a file called `settings.cfg`. You can look at
`default-settings.cfg` to get an idea.

Use a python shell to create a secret key:

    >>> import os
    >>> os.urandom(24)
    '\xfd{H\xe5<\x95\xf9\xe3\x96.5\xd1\x01O<!\xd5\xa2\xa0\x9fR"\xa1\xa8'

### Tests 

Use `nosetests test` to run tests


Usage
-----

### Pages

Simblin pages are simply blog posts in the category `pages' with disabled
comments. The order of pages is determined by their id. So to retroactively
change the order of the pages copy their content, delete all pages and recreate
them in the desired order. 

### Source Code Highlighting

Source code highlighting is enabled by the [CodeColor][] extension of
[Markdown2][] and you don't have to be afraid to use underscores in your code
thanks to [CodeFriendly].

### What's the difference between categories and tags in Simblin?

Tags tell you what topics are talked about in a blog post and categories tell
you where the blog post belongs although sometimes the difference is fluent.
 
Suppose you create a programming tutorial. The blog post could not be in a
category at all and have the tags `programming` and `tutorial`. Or it could be
in the category `programming` and have the tag `tutorial`. I, however, would put
the post in the categories `programming` and `tutorial` and add tags like
`django` if the tutorial would be about django.

Since a blog post, in my world view, can belong in different places a blog post
should be able to have several categories, too. Therefore categories are
essentially implemented like tags. However, tags are deleted automatically when
no posts reference a tag anymore. Categories are not.
  
  
Why another Blog engine?
------------------------

1. Learn about web programming in general
2. Become more experienced with the excellent Flask framework 
3. Have a perfectly tailored blog for my website
