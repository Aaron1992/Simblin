* Style orientation 
** http://demo.jimbarraud.com/manifest/
** http://tomayko.com/ (i like the position of the date)
*** Restyle, like http://tomayko.com/, on entry view no navigation, bigger font...


* Look for Blog Tutorials (to get ideas)
** http://blog.disqus.net/2007/03/11/a-django-primer/
** http://blog.jeffhui.net/2009/03/django-blog-tutorial/

*** Look at how to improve my tests
* Category Support
* Page creation
** Composing pages
** Have no comments
** Order Pages by `place` field
* Ordering of Blog posts, e.g. (Archive Page creation)
** max 5 Entries Home Page ordererd by date
** Monghtly/Yearly archive
** Filter by Tag
** Filter by Category
** Show all tags and number of posts for a tag
* Link "Show source" (only on entry page) that opens the pure mkd source of the blog post in a new window
* Only show login/compose on mouseover (pure js)
* Tab key does indent in compose editor
* Maybe Use WTForms: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/wtforms/
