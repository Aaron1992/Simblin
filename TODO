* install traffic logger in cherokee
    * how to automatically stop server after specific amount of traffic is reached? (rrdtool can be supposedly used for that)
* create e-mail adress blog@eugenkiss.com
    * ispconfig, webmin (usermin), kloxo
* create contact page
    * erecht-24 ask in forum what to put there (international audience) and in
      which language (german, because I am in germany and servers are?)
        * does it have to be called "impressum" or ist "contact" enough?
* BUG: Before implementation add test for that.
       next and prev does not work with simply adding/removing 1 to current id,
       simply because you can delete posts and ids can show nowhere. Better 
       order posts by date and get the first post after/before the current
       Order by date too on archives page latest posts.
* get community feedback
* submit: http://flask.poweredsites.org/ or http://flask.pocoo.org/community/poweredby/
* When previewing an existing Page, show the date of the page, not just now()!
* be able to rename categories
* feeds
* Refactor(pyflakes/epydoc)/Tests/Document/Readme/Changelog

-> v0.4


----------------

* Javascript Tag suggestion
* Put hardcoded Messages in config file (localisation?)
* make datetime field explicitly settable, both in the model
  and on the compose page through a datetime widget
    * set default to now but when updating load saved date
    * This has a lot of implications especially the id of the posts 
      cannot be used as a relative time measurement. Views that rely on
      that should be rewritten to rely on the date. Test should be added
      before that, where id and date give different relative time measurement.
