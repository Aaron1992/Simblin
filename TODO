* consider visibility on archives view
    * change models to distinguish between visible posts so that when not 
      logger in, e.g. the number of posts in a category is without the 
      invisible
    * consider considering visibility when counting posts associated with a tag
      etc.
* make setup.py 0.3
* Refactor(pyflakes/epydoc)/Tests/Document/Readme/Changelog
* get community feedback

-> v0.3

----------------

* be able to rename categories
* feeds
* Refactor(pyflakes/epydoc)/Tests/Document/Readme/Changelog

-> v0.4


----------------

* Javascript Tag suggestion
* Put hardcoded Messages in config file (localisation?)
* make datetime field explicitly settable, both in the model
  and on the compose page through a datetime widget
    * set default to now but when updating load saved date
    * This has a lot of implications especially the id of the posts 
      cannot be used as a relative time measurement. Views that rely on
      that should be rewritten to rely on the date. Test should be added
      before that, where id and date give different relative time measurement.
