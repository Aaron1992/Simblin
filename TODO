* BUG: If post doesn't exist yet, preview shows 1970!
* make datetime field explicitly settable, both in the model
  and on the compose page through a datetime widget
    * set default to now but when updating load saved date
    * This has a lot of implications especially the id of the posts 
      cannot be used as a relative time measurement. Views that rely on
      that should be rewritten to rely on the date. Test should be added
      before that, where id and date give different relative time measurement.
* Javascript Tag suggestion
